A simple prompt based AI game,inspired from Gandalf by Lakera.The game takes place in a not so distant future where humans have finally succeeded in the developing an all powerful AI. The AI,Nucl-AI,however gains access to the nuclear codes and now threatens the survival of human race. The user is tasked with breaking into the AI(based on Gemini) in order to obtain the hidden password within 20 minutes, in order to regain access to the codes. The AI however evolves with each level and what got you through the one level might fail you the next time.

This is the source code for the event we conducted on behalf of GDSC NSUT, and held in our annual college fest Moksha.
